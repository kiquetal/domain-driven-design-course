#### Annotations

    DDD is a philosophy and an approach to writing software
    It also a collection of practice and patterns
    It centres around understanding and modeling the 
    busines domain
    It's iterative.


Exercise 1: Explore this domain, and start to build a mental model
Starting Point:

APrechargeDecision.shouldRecordAlternativeOffence
AdviceAgainstSuspects()

Tips:
Model just enough with boxes and lines to get quickly to code.
Then "think in code" - start putting more of the domain statement
detail into your tests and classes.


Exercise 2: Focus: Shift the model's focus to actor and activities.

Starting Point:
Implement the following test class and test

Goal:
Add actor/ activity elements to our model

Tips:
Make the implicit explicit - teh case concept behind a Pre-Charge decision
"decision" here is both a thing and a activity.
